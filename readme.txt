# 2267683-windows-virus
I do not know who wrote this virus, but it wasted a lot of my time. I would request the computer security guys to find out what it is and what it does.
Change the .txt extension of this file to .vbs and it should work.
I used a few Anti Virus software to detect this virus, but none could.
